Please disable NPTL if possible by setting the environment variable LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1. Recent versions of the Freenet installer should have this already; either reinstall, or edit run.sh (https://emu.freenetproject.org/svn/trunk/apps/installer/installclasspath/run.sh). On some systems you may need to install the pthreads libraries to make this work. Note that the node will try to automatically restart itself in the event of such a deadlock, but this is not be 100% reliable and will take time.

NodeClientCore.ignoreTooManyPathComponents=Ignore too many path components
NodeClientCore.ignoreTooManyPathComponentsLong=If true, the node won't generate TOO_MANY_PATH_COMPONENTS errors when a URI is fed to it which has extra, meaningless subdirs (/blah/blah) on the end beyond what is needed to fetch the key (for example, old CHKs will often have filenames stuck on the end which weren't part of the original insert; this is obsolete because we can now include the filename, and it is confusing to be able to add arbitrary strings to a URI, and it makes them hard to compare). Only enable this option if you need it for compatibility with older apps; it will be removed soon.

ExtOldAgeUserAlert.extTooOldTitle=Freenet-ext too old

IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressTitle=Unknown external address
IPUndetectedUserAlert.detecting=Freenet is currently attempting to detect your external IP address. If this takes more than a few minutes there is something wrong...
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddress=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your NAT or Firewall). You can still exchange references with other people, however this will only work if the other user is not behind a NAT or Firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address. You can determine your current IP address and tell your node with the 'Temporary IP address hint' ${link}configuration parameter${/link}. Also, it would be a good idea to forward the port ${port} on your router for UDP to make it easy to connect to your node.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.detectingWithConfigLink=Freenet is currently attempting to detect your external IP address. If this takes more than a few minutes there is something wrong and you can use the Temporary IP Address Hint ${link}configuration parameter${/link}. Also, it would be a good idea to forward the port ${port} on your router for UDP to make it easier to connect to your node.
IPUndetectedUserAlert.unknownAddressWithConfigLink=Freenet was unable to determine your external IP address (or the IP address of your NAT-device or firewall). You can still exchange references with other people, however this will only work if the other user is not behind a NAT-device or firewall. As soon as you have connected to one other user in this way, Freenet will be able to determine your external IP address.

Also, it would be a good idea to forward the port ${port} on your router for UDP to make it easy to connect to your node.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNickTitle=Your node name isn't defined.
MeaningfulNodeNameUserAlert.noNodeNick=It seems that your node doesn't know your nickname. Putting your e-mail address or IRC nickname here is generally speaking a good idea and helps your friends to identify your node (note that only your darknet peers listed on the friends page can see your node name, it will not be displayed to opennet peers).

PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTimeTitle=nodeAveragePingTime too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeersTitle=Never connected peer(s) too old
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTestnet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to peers run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. But since this is a testnet node, we suggest that you log on to irc.freenode.net channel #freenet-refs and ask around for somebody to connect to.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersDarknet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to peers run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. You could log on to irc.freenode.net channel #freenet-refs and ask around for somebody to connect to, but remember that you are vulnerable to those you are directly connected to. (This is especially true in this early alpha of Freenet 0.7...) BE SURE THAT THE OTHER PERSON HAS ADDED YOUR REFERENCE, TOO, AS ONE-WAY CONNECTIONS WON'T WORK!
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConns=This node has not been able to connect to any other nodes so far; it will not be able to function normally. Hopefully some of your peers will connect soon; if not, try to get some more peers. You need at least 3 peers at any time, and should aim for 5-10.
PeerManagerUserAlert.oneConn=This node only has one connection. Performance will be impaired, and you have no anonymity nor even plausible deniability if that one person is malicious. Your node is attached to the network like a "leaf" and does not contribute to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeerManagerUserAlert.twoConns=This node has only two connections. Performance and security will not be very good, and your node is not doing any routing for other nodes. Your node is embedded like a 'chain' in the network and does not contribute (much) to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnected=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added your reference. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedWithLink=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added ${link}your reference${/link}. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnected=This node has too many disconnected peers (${count} > ${max}). This will have a slight impact on your performance as disconnected peers also consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list. Note that ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know. Even if not, adding lots of nodes automatically is bad as it does not produce an optimal topology.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConns=This node has too many connections (${count} > ${max}). Adding large numbers of nodes automatically does not produce a small-world topology, hurts routing, and risks producing single points of failure.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyPeers=This node has too many peers (${count} > ${max}). We do not recommend running ubernodes with automated addition of peers; this does not produce a small world network topology. This will also marginally impact your performance as disconnected peers consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTime=This node has to wait too long for available bandwidth (${delay}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTime=This node is having trouble talking with its peers quickly enough (${ping}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeers=One or more of your node's peers have never connected in the two weeks since they were added.  Consider removing them since they are marginally affecting performance (wasting packets talking to nodes that aren't there).
RevocationKeyFoundUserAlert.title=The private key of the project has been compromized!
