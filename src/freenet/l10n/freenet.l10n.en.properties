Announcer.announceAlertIntro=Freenet is connecting to the network - this may take a few minutes. Performance will continue to improve during the next few hours. This will happen each time you shut down Freenet for more than a few minutes, so try to leave it running 24 hours a day if possible.
Announcer.announceAlertTitle=Node Announcing
Announcer.announceDetails=We have recently sent ${recentSentAnnouncements} announcements, ${runningAnnouncements} of which are still running, and added ${addedNodes} nodes (${refusedNodes} nodes have rejected us). We are currently connected to ${connectedSeednodes} seednodes and trying to connect to another ${disconnectedSeednodes}.
Announcer.announceAlertNoSeednodes=There is no seednodes.fref file found, so the node will not be able to automatically bootstrap itself onto the opennet. Please add some nodes manually, or download the seednodes file from http://downloads.freenetproject.org/alpha/opennet/ .
Announcer.announceLoading=Freenet is currently loading the seednodes file so that it can attempt to announce to the rest of the network. Announcement may take a few minutes.
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldTitle=Announcement disabled (too old)
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOld=This node appears to be too old to connect to the current Freenet network. We have disabled announcement, since it is not getting anywhere. Please update your node as soon as possible (auto-updating may be waiting for input or it may be disabled).
Announcer.announceDisabledTooOldShort=The node has tried to connect to the network but your copy of Freenet is too old. You should upgrade.
Announcer.announceAlertShort=The node is trying to connect to the network, it will be slow for a while.
Announcer.coolingOff=For the next ${time} seconds, the node is waiting for the nodes that it just announced to to connect, if there are not enough nodes it will try a different node.
Announcer.dontKnowAddress=Freenet has not yet been able to determine our IP address, we cannot announce until we know what it is.

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningPageTitle=You must use a separate browser for Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningShort=You must use a separate browser for Freenet!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarning=We ${bold}strongly${/bold} recommend that you not use the same web browser to both browse the ordinary web and access Freenet. Browser history stealing attacks in particular may enable malicious websites to determine which Freenet-based websites ("freesites") you have recently visited, breaking your anonymity. Please use a separate browser, or at least a separate browser profile, to access the Freenet web interface.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.browserWarningSuggestion=Most web browsers, apart from Microsoft Internet Explorer (which has some issues with content type detection which are difficult to work around), will work adequately with Freenet, for example Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Lynx are known to work. You should install one of these, or create a new profile in your existing browser, then copy the current URL from the location bar, and open it in your new browser.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeName=Node name required!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.chooseNodeNameLong=Please enter a node name in the field below (we recommend a nickname possibly with an email address). This is so that your friends (trusted peers, which you have manually added) can easily tell your node from their other nodes. This is not visible to strangers (untrusted automatically added peers). Note that any friend or stranger may trivially identify you from your IP address, since you are connected to them, but they cannot easily tell what you are requesting.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangers=Connect to strangers?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.connectToStrangersLong=To run Freenet, you must connect to at least five other nodes.  These should ideally be run by people whom you know and trust.  If you don't know enough friends running Freenet, you can choose to connect to strangers' nodes as well.  However, connecting to strangers allows others to find out that you are using Freenet and adds some additional security risks.  If you want to keep your use of Freenet secret, this may get you into trouble.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.enableOpennet=It is possible to turn off stranger connections later on, once you have added enough friends, although you will already have revealed some information to strangers in the meantime.  Freenet is still experimental, and we offer no guarantees about security.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetYes=I want the node to automatically find strangers to connect to. 
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.opennetNo=I have at least 5 friends already using Freenet and I will add their details on the Friends page.

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSize=Datastore size
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.datastoreSizeLong=Please select a size for your datastore. The datastore acts like a cache; storing data for the network will help you to get better throughput when requesting popular files. The more space you can afford the better it is for the community and the faster your node and especially your downloads will go.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}WARNING${/bold}: You are about to set the network security level to high. This means your node will not be able to connect unless ${bold}you add some connections to Friends${/bold}. These should be people you already know and at least marginally trust. If you don't know anyone already using Freenet, please use the NORMAL network security level so that Freenet will setup connections automatically. Adding people you don't know as Friends will not significantly improve security and will harm performance. Also note that HIGH security level is slower, especially if you don't have many Friends (you need 5-10 for adequate performance).
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.highNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=I know at least one person already using Freenet (3 preferably, 5-10 for good performance). I will add them on the Friends page. I understand that Freenet will not work unless some of my Friends are online.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrusted=Is your local network trusted?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.isNetworkTrustedLong=Is your local network trusted? If you answer yes here all the services provided by your node will be wide open to everyone willing to access them on the given network. You will be able to do selective access controls from the configuration page when the wizard is over.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIF=No additional network interface found
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.noNetworkIFLong=Freenet hasn't found any additional network interface. It will assume that you will connect to it from your computer and only from it.
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.iDoTrust=Do you trust people connected to ${interface} (${ip})?
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.congratz=Welcome on board!
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.congratzLong=Congratulations, the base configuration of your Freenet node is now done. You can change and edit any of the parameters you have just set going to the "configuration" page, reachable anytime from the menu on the left of the interface. Please note that Freenet will be slow to start with, it will improve over time. You can get started by clicking on the bookmarks on the next page. We wish you a pleasant Freenet experience.

FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimit=Memory usage
FirstTimeWizardToadlet.memoryLimitLong=How much memory would you like to allow Freenet to use? If you have many downloads or uploads queued, Freenet will need more memory. We suggest you not set this below 128MB unless you are really short of RAM. If you have 1GB or more, you should probably set this to at least 256MB. This will take effect after restarting Freenet.

Node.enablePacketCoalescingLong=Enable packet coalescing? Packet coalescing increases bandwidth efficiency, reduces CPU usage and gains some resistance to traffic analysis at a small cost in message latency. Don't turn this off unless you know what you're doing.
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTables=Enable per-node failure tables?
Node.enablePerNodeFailureTablesLong=Enable automatically rerouting around nodes that failed a request within the last 10 minutes?
Node.enableSwapping=Enable location swapping? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableSwappingLong=Enable location swapping? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF! It is only useful in some simulations).
Node.enableSwapQueueing=Enable queueing of swap requests? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableSwapQueueingLong=Enable queueing of swap requests? (DO NOT TURN THIS OFF!)
Node.enableULPRDataPropagation=Enable ULPR data propagation?
Node.enableULPRDataPropagationLong=Enable fast propagation of recently requested keys to those nodes which have asked for them when the data is eventually found? (Ultra-Lightweight Persistent Requests). 
Node.errorApplyingConfig=Error while applying the new config : ${error}
Node.extraPeerDir=Extra peer data directory
Node.extraPeerDirLong=Name of directory to put extra peer data in
Node.forceBigShrink=Do large store shrinks immediately (bdbje-index store type only)
Node.forceBigShrinkLong=Whether to do large store shrinks (over 10%) immediately (rather than waiting for the next node restart). Online shrinks do not preserve the most recently used data, so this is not recommended; use it only if you must have an immediate result. Specific to bdbje-index store type.
Node.inBWLimit=Input bandwidth limit (bytes per second)
Node.inBWLimitLong=Input bandwidth limit (bytes/sec); the node will try not to exceed this; -1 = 4x set outputBandwidthLimit
Node.invalidStoreSize=Store size must be at least 32MB
Node.l10nLanguage=The language the node will use to display messages
Node.l10nLanguageLong=This setting will change the language used to display messages. Keep in mind that some strings won't be translated until next node startup though.

Node.maxHTLLong=Maximum HTL (FOR DEVELOPER USE ONLY!)
Node.maxOpennetPeers=Maximum number of Opennet peers

Node.mustBePositive=Config value must be positive
Node.nodeDir=Node directory
Node.nodeDirLong=Name of directory to put node-related files e.g. peers list in
Node.nodeName=Nickname for this Freenet node
Node.nodeNameLong=Node nickname. This will be visible to your friends only.
Node.notUsingSunVMTitle=Not using a Sun JVM
Node.notUsingSunVM=You are trying to run the node under a non-Sun JVM: ${vendor} ${version}. This is not recommended: the node may not run well. Please get Sun java from http://www.java.com/getjava/ if possible.
Node.notUsingSunVMShort=Freenet is running on a non-Sun JVM, this is not recommended, please get the latest Sun Java. 
Node.notUsingWrapperTitle=Not using the wrapper!
Node.notUsingWrapper=You are running the node without the wrapper. This is not recommended. The node will not be able to restart itself, so auto-updating won't work, and if the JVM goes off into limbo, it won't get restarted either. Also the node can't generate stack dumps in some places so debugging will be marginally harder.
Node.notUsingWrapperShort=Freenet is running without the wrapper. This is not recommended.
Node.oneConnectionPerIP=Limit to one connection per address?
Node.oneConnectionPerIPLong=Don't allow more than one connection per address? This will make it slightly harder for an attacker to connect more than once to your node as different identities, in order to dominate your routing or make harvesting easier. Also prevents having the same node connected on darknet and opennet simultaneously. 
Node.opennetEnabled=Enable insecure mode (automatically connect to untrusted nodes)?
Node.opennetEnabledLong=Enable insecure mode (aka opennet)? If this is enabled, the node will automatically exchange node references with other untrusted nodes (Strangers as opposed to Friends). But this means that the fact that you are running a node is no longer private, and many attacks are much easier. If you know enough people running Freenet, you should stick to trusted (Friends) connections to them, and turn this off.
Node.outBWLimit=Output bandwidth limit (bytes per second)
Node.outBWLimitLong=Hard output bandwidth limit (bytes/sec); the node should almost never exceed this
Node.paddDataPackets=Pad data packets sent by the node with random-length content? (READ WARNING!)
Node.paddDataPacketsLong=Pad data packets sent by the node with random-length content? For security, on a single node, turning this off is bad; if a large part of the network starts doing it, we become very vulnerable to a passive attacker. However, it should improve performance, particularly the payload percentage. You have been warned!
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknet=Relay opennet noderefs through darknet peers?
Node.passOpennetPeersThroughDarknetLong=If true, opennet noderefs (NEVER our own darknet noderef) will be relayed through our darknet peers. So a node (this node, or its peers) can get opennet peers from its darknet peers. This is useful because it allows us to bootstrap new opennet peers after having lost our peers due to downtime, for example. However, it may make traffic analysis slightly easier, so turn it off if you are paranoid.
Node.port=FNP port number (UDP)
Node.portLong=UDP port for node-to-node communications (Freenet Node Protocol)
Node.publishOurPeersLocation=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers?
Node.publishOurPeersLocationLong=Shall we send our peers' locations to our peers? Doing so helps routing but gives some information away to a potential attacker.
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocation=Shall we use the locations of the peers of our peers into account for routing purposes?
Node.routeAccordingToOurPeersLocationLong=Shall we use the locations of the peers of our peers into account for routing purposes? Doing so helps routing but might help a potential attacker.

Node.storeMaxMemTooHigh=Giving more than 80% of your ram to BDB is probably not what you want to do!
Node.storePreallocate=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storePreallocateLong=Preallocate space for datastore
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStart=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only)
Node.storeSaltHashResizeOnStartLong=Resize store on node start (salt-hash only). If this is true, the node will complete resizing the datastore during startup. This will complete much faster than doing it "on the fly", but on the other hand the node will not be available for some time while it completes the resize.
Node.storeSaltHashMigratedShort=Datastore migration finished!
Node.storeSaltHashMigrated=Datastore migration finished! You may now delete the old datastore files:
Node.storeSize=Store size in bytes
Node.storeSizeLong=Store size in bytes
Node.storeType=Store type (LEAVE THIS ALONE)
Node.storeTypeLong=Datastore type. Currently this can be salt-hash (EXPERIMENTAL, use a salted on-disk hashtable with bloom filter), bdb-index (STABLE, use a BerkeleyDBFreenetStore to store the index, and keep the data in files on disk), or ram (FOR TESTING ONLY, keep the index and the data in RAM). Only use ram if you know what you are doing and have enough RAM to store all your data (and note it will not be saved on shutdown)! Changes will not take effect until Freenet has been restarted.
Node.storeBloomFilterSize=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes
Node.storeBloomFilterSizeLong=Bloom filter size (total) in bytes. Usually 1/2048th the size of data store is more than enough. Set this to zero to disable bloom filter. Set this to -1 to reset to default.
Node.storeBloomFilterCounting=Use counting bloom filter?
Node.storeBloomFilterCountingLong=Use 2-bit counting bloom filter? (don't touch this unless you know what you are doing) 
Node.swapRInterval=Swap request send interval (ms)
Node.swapRIntervalLong=Interval between swap attempting to send swap requests in milliseconds. Leave this alone!
Node.throttleLocalTraffic=Throttle local traffic?
Node.throttleLocalTrafficLong=Throttle local traffic? If enabled, even LAN and localhost traffic will be subject to bandwidth limiting.
Node.tooSmallMTU=Too small MTU
Node.tooSmallMTULong=Your connection's MTU appears to be ${mtu} bytes. Freenet will not function well with an MTU of less than ${minMTU} bytes: connections will be unreliable and possibly slow. Please fix the problem if possible.
Node.tooSmallMTUShort=Connection problems: Your connection's MTU is too short for Freenet to work well. Expect problems.
Node.withAnnouncement=Allow the node to bootstrap itself using seednodes? (Leave this alone unless you know what you're doing)
Node.withAnnouncementLong=Allow the node to bootstrap itself using seednodes? To get onto the opennet (the Strangers network, automatic Freenet connection on low/normal network security level), we contact public nodes chosen from a small list shipped with Freenet. Obviously this is somewhat insecure, but if you are using opennet, you probably need it: if your node is down for a while, especially if it is NATed and/or changes its IP address, it will probably need to reseed. If you want better security, you need to connect to your friends and enable high network security.

NodeClientCore.downloadDir=Default download directory
NodeClientCore.downloadDirLong=The directory to save downloaded files into by default
NodeClientCore.encryptPersistentTempBuckets=Encrypt the persistent temporary buckets? LEAVE THIS ALONE!
NodeClientCore.encryptPersistentTempBucketsLong=Encrypt the persistent temporary buckets? In some cases (if you use hard-drive and swap encryption) it might not make sense to encrypt persistent temporary buckets. LEAVE THIS ALONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
NodeClientCore.encryptTempBuckets=Encrypt the temporary buckets? LEAVE THIS ALONE!
NodeClientCore.encryptTempBucketsLong=Encrypt the temporary buckets? In some cases (if you use hard-drive and swap encryption) it might not make sense to encrypt temporary buckets. LEAVE THIS ALONE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStats=File to store client statistics in
NodeClientCore.fileForClientStatsLong=File to store client throttling statistics in (used to decide how often to send requests)
NodeClientCore.lazyResume=Complete loading of persistent requests after startup? (Uses more memory)
NodeClientCore.lazyResumeLong=The node can load persistent queued requests during startup, or it can read the data into memory and then complete the request resuming process after the node has started up. Shorter start-up times, but uses more memory.
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchers=Maximum number of allowed USK fetchers
NodeClientCore.maxUSKFetchersLong=Maximum number of allowed USK fetchers

NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSize=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets
NodeClientCore.ramBucketPoolSizeLong=Amount of RAM to dedicate to temporary buckets. The tradeoff is more memory usage against more IOs.
NodeClientCore.startingUpTitle=Freenet is starting up
NodeClientCore.startingUp=Please allow Freenet a few moments to complete the startup process, in the meantime some things may not work and the node may be slower than usual.
NodeClientCore.startingUpShort=Freenet is starting up, some things may not work and the node may be slow.
NodeClientCore.tempDir=Temp files directory
NodeClientCore.tempDirLong=Name of directory to put temporary files in
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirs=Directories uploading is allowed from
NodeClientCore.uploadAllowedDirsLong=Semicolon separated list of directories from which uploads are allowed. Empty means no uploads from disk allowed, "all" means uploads allowed from anywhere (including system files etc!). WARNING! If this is set to "all" any file on your computer can be uploaded by any user with access to FCP.
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddress=Include local addresses in noderef
NodeIPDectector.inclLocalAddressLong=Whether to include local addresses (LAN and localhost) in node references. This will not be useful unless the both sides set allowLocalAddresses=true for the respective references (use the Friends page in advanced mode to set this flag).
NodeIPDectector.ipOverride=IP address override
NodeIPDectector.ipOverrideLong=IP address override (not usually needed) - set this if you have a *static* IP address or a domain name (e.g. via dyndns), and you are behind a firewall.
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHint=Temporary IP address hint
NodeIPDectector.tempAddressHintLong=Temporary hint to what our IP might be; deleted after use
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetric=It looks like your node may be behind a symmetric NAT. You may have connection problems: If you are behind a symmetric NAT you will probably only be able to connect to peers which are open to the internet.
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricTitle=Connection problems
NodeIPDetector.maybeSymmetricShort=Connection problems: You may be behind a symmetric NAT.
NodeIPDetector.unknownHostErrorInIPOverride=Unknown host: ${error}
NodeStat.aggressiveGC=AggressiveGC modificator
NodeStat.aggressiveGCLong=Enables the user to tweak the time in between GC and forced finalization. SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED unless you know what you're doing! -1 means: disable forced call to System.gc() and System.runFinalization()
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiability=Treat local requests as remote requests for bandwidth liability limiting?
NodeStat.ignoreLocalVsRemoteBandwidthLiabilityLong=Enable this for significantly lower bandwidth usage and slightly more security against request starting timing attacks (mostly you don't need to worry about them as correlation attacks are probably easier)
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThreshold=Free heap bytes threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapBytesThresholdLong=The node will try to keep it's free heap bytes above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThreshold=Free heap percent threshold
NodeStat.freeHeapPercentThresholdLong=The node will try to keep it's free heap percentage (of max heap bytes allowed) above the threshold by refusing new requests
NodeStat.memCheck=Enable the Memory check
NodeStat.memCheckLong=Enable the memory check (writes a message in logfile, mandatory for aggressiveGCModificator to have any effect!)
NodeStat.statsPersister=File to store node statistics in
NodeStat.statsPersisterLong=File to store node statistics in (not client statistics, and these are used to decide whether to accept requests so please don't delete)
NodeStat.threadLimit=Thread limit
NodeStat.threadLimitLong=The node will try to limit its thread usage to the specified value, refusing new requests
NodeStats.mustBePercentValueNotFull=This value must be a percentage between 0 and 99.
NodeStats.valueTooLow=This value is too low for that setting, increase it!
NodeUpdateManager.enabled=Check for, and download new versions
NodeUpdateManager.enabledLong=Should your node automatically check for new versions of Freenet. If yes, new versions will be automatically detected and downloaded, but not necessarily installed. This setting resets itself always back to false unless the node runs within the wrapper.
NodeUpdateManager.extURI=Where should the node look for updates to freenet-ext.jar?
NodeUpdateManager.extURILong=Where should the node look for updates to freenet-ext.jar?
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersions=Automatically install new versions
NodeUpdateManager.installNewVersionsLong=Should your node automatically update to the newest version of Freenet, without asking?
NodeUpdateManager.invalidExtURI=Invalid ext URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.invalidRevocationURI=Invalid revocation URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.invalidUpdateURI=Invalid update URI: ${error}
NodeUpdateManager.noUpdateWithoutWrapper=Cannot update because not running under wrapper
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURI=Where should the node look for the revocation key?
NodeUpdateManager.revocationURILong=URI for the revocation key. If this is found the node will display its contents and disable the auto-updater.
NodeUpdateManager.updateCatastropheTitle=Catastrophic Update Failure!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailed=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedTitle=Update Failed!
NodeUpdateManager.updateFailedShort=Update Failed: ${reason}
NodeUpdateManager.updateURI=Where should the node look for updates?
NodeUpdateManager.updateURILong=Where should the node look for updates?
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.title=Not enough Nice levels available!
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.short=Not enough Nice levels available! Please run Freenet at a lower nice level.
NotEnoughNiceLevelsUserAlert.content=Your node has detected that it is running at a high nice level. It can't perform well if they aren't enough levels available. Please lower the nice level you're node is running at (Look for PRIORITY in the run.sh file and lower its value)! Currently your node has ${available} levels to play with whereas it would need ${required}.

PacketSender.somePeersDisconnectedBlockedTooLong=Probably a bug: please report: ${count} peers forcibly disconnected due to blocking for a packet number for over 10 minutes.
PacketSender.somePeersDisconnectedBlockedTooLongDetail=${count} of your peers are having severe problems (failing to allocate a packet number after 10 minutes). This is probably due to a bug in the code. Please report it to us at the bug tracker at ${link}https://bugs.freenetproject.org/${/link} or to the support mailing list support@freenetproject.org. Please include this message and what version of the node you are running. The affected peers (you may not want to include this in your bug report if they are darknet peers) are:
PNGFilter.invalidHeader=The file you tried to fetch is not a PNG. It does not include a valid PNG header. It might be some other file format, and your browser may do something dangerous with it, therefore we have blocked it.
PNGFilter.invalidHeaderTitle=Not a PNG - invalid header
PeerManagerUserAlert.connErrorTitle=Some peers cannot connect
PeerManagerUserAlert.connError=${count} of your peers cannot connect for an unknown reason, possibly because of a buggy node or a corrupt node reference.
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblemTitle=Clock problem
PeerManagerUserAlert.clockProblem=${count} of your nodes are unable to connect because their system clock is more than 24 hours different to yours. Please check whether your computer has the correct time. Incorrect time will cause many node and client mechanisms to fail.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConns=This node has not been able to connect to any other nodes so far; it will not be able to function normally. Hopefully some of your peers will connect soon; if not, try to get some more peers. You need at least 3 peers at any time, and should aim for 5-10.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noConnsTitle=No open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersDarknet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to peers run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. You could set the network security level to NORMAL or LOW to enable connecting to strangers and quickly get some connections.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTestnet=This node has no peers to connect to, therefore it will not be able to function normally. Ideally you should connect to peers run by people you know (if you are paranoid, then people you trust; if not, then at least people you've talked to). You need at least 3 connected peers at all times, and ideally 5-10. You could set the network security level to NORMAL or LOW to enable connecting to strangers and quickly get some connections.
PeerManagerUserAlert.noPeersTitle=No peers found
PeerManagerUserAlert.oneConn=This node only has one connection. Performance will be impaired, and you have no anonymity nor even plausible deniability if that one person is malicious. Your node is attached to the network like a "leaf" and does not contribute to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeerManagerUserAlert.onlyFewConnsTitle=Only ${count} open connection(s)
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTime=This node has to wait too long for available bandwidth (${delay}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighBwlimitDelayTimeTitle=bwlimitDelayTime too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTime=This node is having trouble talking with its peers quickly enough (${ping}ms > ${max}ms). Increase your output bandwidth limit and/or remove some peers to improve the situation.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooHighPingTimeTitle=nodeAveragePingTime too high
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConns=This node has too many connections (${count} > ${max}). Adding large numbers of nodes automatically does not produce a small-world topology, hurts routing, and risks producing single points of failure.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyConnsTitle=Too many open connections
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnected=This node has too many disconnected peers (${count} > ${max}). This will have a slight impact on your performance as disconnected peers also consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list. Note that ideally you should connect to nodes run by people you know. Even if not, adding lots of nodes automatically is bad as it does not produce an optimal topology.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyDisconnectedTitle=Too many disconnected peers
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnected=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added your reference. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedTitle=Many peers have not connected once yet
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyNeverConnectedWithLink=Many of this node's peers have never connected even once: ${count}. You should not add peers unless you know that they have also added ${link}your reference${/link}. Otherwise they will not connect.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyPeers=This node has too many peers (${count} > ${max}). We do not recommend running ubernodes with automated addition of peers; this does not produce a small world network topology. This will also marginally impact your performance as disconnected peers consume a small amount of bandwidth and CPU. Consider "cleaning up" your peer list.
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooManyPeersTitle=Too many peers
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeers=One or more of your node's peers have never connected in the two weeks since they were added.  Consider removing them since they are marginally affecting performance (wasting packets talking to nodes that aren't there).
PeerManagerUserAlert.tooOldNeverConnectedPeersTitle=Never connected peer(s) too old
PeerManagerUserAlert.twoConns=This node has only two connections. Performance and security will not be very good, and your node is not doing any routing for other nodes. Your node is embedded like a 'chain' in the network and does not contribute (much) to the network's health. Try to get at least 3 (ideally more like 5-10) connected peers at any given time.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.intro=One or more of your peers says that the auto-update key is blown! This means that an attacker may know the private key for the auto-update system and can therefore cause your node to run code of his choice (if you update)! The auto-update system has been disabled. It is also possible that your peers are deliberately lying about it.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.fetching=Your node is attempting to download the revocation certificate to find out more details.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedFetch=Your node has been unable to download the revocation certificate. Possible causes include an attack on your node to try to get you to update despite the key being blown, or your nodes lying about the key being blown. Please contact the developers or other Freenet users to sort out this mess.
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.connectedSayBlownLabel=These connected nodes say that the key has been blown (we are trying to download the revocation cert from them):
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.disconnectedSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the key has been blown, but then disconnected, so we could not fetch the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.failedTransferSayBlownLabel=These nodes told us that the key has been blown, but then failed to transfer the revocation certificate:
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.titleWithCount=Auto-update key blown according to ${count} peer(s)!
PeersSayKeyBlownAlert.short=Some of your peers say the auto-update key is blown!

SecurityLevels.title=Security levels
SecurityLevels.tooltip=Configure the node's degree of security
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelShort=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the Internet
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel=How much security do you need against Internet providers, corporations, governments, bored kids etc attempting to monitor your use of Freenet?
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.MAXIMUM=MAXIMUM
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.MAXIMUM=I intend to access information that could get me arrested, imprisoned, or worse. I understand that Freenet is experimental and cannot ensure security against certain known attacks, but I accept the risks compared to the alternatives.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.MAXIMUM=Freenet will be ${bold}significantly${/bold} slower than in HIGH, and ${bold}you must have friends running Freenet to use this mode${/bold}.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=I would like to make it much more difficult for others to monitor my communications, or I am worried about ISPs trying to block Freenet.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=Freenet will only connect to your friends, so ${bold}you must have friends already using Freenet to select this mode${/bold}. Freenet will be slow unless you add at least 5-10 friends, and won't work at all if you don't have at least 1.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I live in a relatively free country, but I would like to make it more difficult for others to monitor my communications.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=Freenet will be reasonably careful to protect your anonymity, at some performance cost. Freenet will automatically connect to unknown nodes.  We recommend that you add friends running Freenet and upgrade to HIGH.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I do not care about monitoring and want maximum performance.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevel.desc.LOW=It may be quite easy for others to discover your identity!
SecurityLevels.noFriendsWarning=You have not added any Friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will be unable to connect to Freenet until you have at least one connected Friend! Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, these must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, enable high network security level, I will add some Friends ASAP.
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsWarning=You do not have any connected Friends, although you have added ${added} friends. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, you will only be able to connect to Freenet when your friends are online, which they are not at the moment. You should add additional Friends, only use Freenet when your friends are connected, or not upgrade to high security. Note that for there to be any meaningful security benefit, your Friends must be people you actually know and at least marginally trust, and for good performance you will need at least 5-10 of them connected at any time. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.noConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept that Freenet will only be online when my existing Friends are online.
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsWarning=You only have ${connected} connected Friends right now, and you have added ${added} friends in total. If you set the network security level to high or maximum, Freenet will only connect to your Friends, so your performance may be significantly reduced, and if all your Friends are offline then it will not be able to connect at all. Note that Friends must be people you know and at least marginally trust for there to be any real security benefit, and you will need at least 5-10 connected Friends for good performance. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.fewConnectedFriendsCheckbox=I am sure, I will add more Friends and/or I accept the performance cost and the fact that Freenet may not connect when my Friends are offline.
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowWarning=You are about to downgrade your node's network security level to low. This means that it will be easy for strangers to attack your anonymity over the Internet. Are you sure?
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelLowCheckbox=I am sure, I want more speed and I don't care who can tell what I'm doing with Freenet!
SecurityLevels.networkThreatLevelConfirmTitle=WARNING: Setting network security level to ${mode}
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelWarning=${bold}WARNING:${/bold} You are about to set the maximum network security level! This will ${bold}significantly${/bold} slow down Freenet for you! Please do not do this unless you really need the security!
SecurityLevels.maxSecurityYouNeedFriends=${bold}You must know at least one person already running Freenet${/bold}, preferably 3, 5-10 for good performance. You must add them on the Friends page. These must be people you already know and at least marginally trust.
SecurityLevels.maximumNetworkThreatLevelCheckbox=Yes I really want to enable maximum security, I understand that Freenet is still experimental and it may still be possible to trace me, and that this setting may dramatically reduce Freenet's performance!
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevelShort=Protection if your friends attack your anonymity
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel=How concerned are you about those you add as friends attempting to monitor your activities, either deliberately or as a result of their computers being compromised? (This is a default level and for most purposes can be overridden on a per-friend basis.) If you set the network security level to HIGH above, then the friends security level determines performance, along with the number of friends added.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevelConfirmTitle=WARNING: Setting friends security level to ${mode}
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.name.HIGH=HIGH
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.choice.HIGH=I would like Freenet to take extra precautions to avoid attacks from friends.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.desc.HIGH=Freenet will avoid sharing information with friends and so will be somewhat slower than in NORMAL mode.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I am not overly concerned about attacks from friends, but I would like Freenet to take reasonable precautions.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=Freenet will share a limited amount of information with friends, and be slower than in LOW mode.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I am not concerned about attacks from friends. I trust my friends and their computer security abilities.
SecurityLevels.friendsThreatLevel.desc.LOW=Freenet will share a lot of information with your friends' nodes to maximize performance.
SecurityLevels.highFriendsThreatLevelWarning=You are about to set your friends threat level to high. This will reduce Freenet's performance, and shouldn't be necessary most of the time. If the reason you are setting this is that you have added people you don't know as Friends, you should consider whether you would be better off disconnecting from them and downgrading your network level to NORMAL if necessary. On the other hand if you expect an attacker to compromize your friends' computers or actively seek to turn them against you, this may be a prudent precaution.
SecurityLevels.highFriendsThreatLevelCheckbox=I am sure I need high level protection against compromised or treacherous friends' nodes.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevelShort=Protection if your computer is seized or stolen
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel=How concerned are you about your computer being physically seized and examined?
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.NORMAL=NORMAL
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.name.LOW=LOW
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.NORMAL=I am concerned.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.NORMAL=Freenet will encrypt temporary files etc, at a small performance cost, but you should take additional precautions such as disabling your browser cache when using the web interface. If you use persistent downloads (most tools do), you should encrypt the drive Freenet is running on.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.choice.LOW=I am not concerned.
SecurityLevels.physicalThreatLevel.desc.LOW=Freenet will avoid disk encryption and leave traces of what you have visited on your hard disk, improving performance at the expense of lower security if your computer is seized.
SecurityLevels.userAlertShortText=Security levels: Network: ${network}, Friends: ${friends}, Physical: ${physical}
SecurityLevels.userAlertNetworkThreatLevel=Protection against a stranger attacking you over the Internet: ${level}
SecurityLevels.userAlertFriendsThreatLevel=Protection if your friends attack your anonymity: ${level}

UnknownContentTypeException.explanation=Your Freenet node does not know anything about this MIME type. This means that your browser might do something dangerous in response to downloading this file. For example, many formats can contain embedded images or videos, which are downloaded from the web; this is by no means innocuous, because they can ruin your anonymity and expose your IP address (if the attacker runs the web site or has access to its logs). Hyperlinks to the Web can also be a threat, for much the same reason, as can scripting, for this and other reasons.
