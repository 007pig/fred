/**
 * These must be deleted once the request has been executed. See RegisterMe.
 * 
 * When we choose a request on the database thread, if it is persistent, we store it to the database.
 * The reason for this is that we may crash before it completes, in which case we don't want to lose 
 * it, and the process of choosing a request is destructive i.e. it will be removed from the queue
 * structures before removeFirst() returns. If we do it this way we get the best of all worlds:
 * - We remove the data from the queue, so the request won't be chosen again until it's done, and
 *   choosing requests won't have to go over and ignore a lot of slots.
 * - If we restart, we will restart the persistent requests we were running, and will therefore get
 *   all the relevant callbacks.
