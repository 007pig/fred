Initiator-Responder:
This is a straightforward DiffieHellman exponential.
The Initiator Nonce serves two purposes;it allows the initiator to use the same
exponentials during different sessions while ensuring that the resulting 			 session key will be different,can be used to differentiate between parallel sessions 

Responder-Initiator:
Responder replies with a signed copy of his own exponential, a random nonce and an authenticator calculated from a transient hash key private to the responder.
We slightly deviate JFK here;we do not send any public key information
as specified in the JFK docs 

Initiator-Responder:
Initiator echoes the data sent by the responder including the authenticator. This helps
the responder verify the authenticity of the returned data. Rejection messages do not
concern us because grpinfo which is sent in Message2 indicates which groups and algorithms 
are acceptable avoiding the need for explicit message rejection. 

Responder-Initiator:
Encrypted message of the signature
on both nonces, both exponentials using the same keys as in the previous message
