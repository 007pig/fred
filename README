This is the 0.7 rewrite of Freenet. This is largely rewritten from scratch, 
although it pulls in a load of code from Dijjer, and most of the crypto and a 
few other classes from the 0.5 source.

Major changes:
- Darknet mode: connect only to your friends, they connect to theirs, this forms
  a small-world network, which Freenet makes routable by location swapping. This
  greatly increases the network's robustness as it makes it much harder to find
  and block Freenet nodes on a national firewall, as well as improving security
  generally provided that your friends are trustworthy. 
- Opennet mode (plug and play) is also supported. Just select network security
  level NORMAL or LOW in the first-time wizard.
- Freenet now uses UDP, mainly to improve connectivity over NATs and firewalls.
- Freenet now uses 32kB fixed block sizes, to improve performance and simplify 
  the code.
- The Freenet Client Protocol is completely different, see the spec here:
  http://wiki.freenetproject.org/FreenetFCPSpec2Point0
- Many more changes...

ALWAYS ON:
On OS/X and unix-based systems, Freenet will create a cron job to run Freenet 
on startup. On Windows it creates a user for Freenet to run under, and a service 
to start it. You should run Freenet as close to 24x7 as possible for good 
performance. It is however possible to remove the cron job (with the remove cron 
job script in bin/), or to remove the service (from the services panel in Control Panel).

LICENSING:
Freenet is under the GPLv2 - see LICENSE.Freenet (we are trying to make this
GPL 2 or later, but some code is arguably GPL 2 only). However, we use some 
other code:
- Mantissa is under the modified BSD license. See README.Mantissa. According 
  to the FSF, modified BSD is compatible with GPL; we must include both 
  licenses.
